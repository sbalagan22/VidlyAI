# Privacy Policy for VidlyAI

**Last Updated:** [Date]

VidlyAI ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our Chrome extension, VidlyAI.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. User-Provided Information
- **API Keys:** To use the AI features of the extension, you may provide your own API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic). These keys are stored locally on your device (in Chrome's local storage) and are never sent to our servers.
- **Prompts and Queries:** When you ask a question or provide a prompt to the AI, that text is sent directly to the third-party AI provider you have selected.

### B. Automatically Collected Information
- **Video Transcripts:** To provide summaries and answers about a YouTube video, the extension retrieves the transcript of the video you are currently watching. This transcript is sent directly to the third-party AI provider you have selected as part of the context for your query.
- **Usage Data:** We do not collect analytics or usage data about how you interact with the extension. The extension runs entirely client-side.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information solely to provide the core functionality of the extension:
- **Transcripts and Prompts:** These are used to generate AI responses to your questions about the video.

## 3. Data Sharing and Third Parties
VidlyAI does not collect or store your data. However, the extension interacts with third-party AI providers that you select:
- **AI Providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic):** When you use the extension, your prompts and the video transcripts are sent to the API of the provider you selected. Please review the privacy policy of your chosen AI provider to understand how they handle your data.

## 4. Data Security
- **Local Storage:** Your API keys and settings are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's `storage.local` API.
- **Direct Transmission:** Data is transmitted directly from your browser to the third-party AI provider's API. It does not pass through any intermediary server owned by VidlyAI.
